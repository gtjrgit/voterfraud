Data science capstone project: Did millions of people vote illegally in the 2016 general election?

President Trump claims as many as 5 million people voted illegally in the election, which resulted in his losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Yet federal election officials say no such voter fraud exists. By comparing the number of registered voters to the total number of votes tallied, voter fraud can be confirmed or discounted. 

Preliminary data to use:
- Voter registration
- Official voting results
- Census Bureau population statistics
- Voter fraud investigations
- Estimated illegal immigrant population


Approach: 
Of the 136,629,046 votes tallied, Clinton received 65,844,954 and Trump received 62,979,879 -- a difference of 2,865,075. In California, which accounted for more than 14 million total votes, Clinton won the popular vote by more than 4 million votes. Is this where all, most, or even some illegal votes were cast? 

Focusing on California, the state with the most votes and largest voting disparity, determine how many, if any, votes were cast illegally. 

Deliverables: Slide deck and code.
